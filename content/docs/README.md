# Welcome to Countr Documentation

This folder is for the documentation, and is displayed on [countr.xyz/docs](https://countr.xyz/docs). Want to contribute? Read below for more information!

## General rules for documentation

* The documentation must be of good quality and relevance.
* Required file name format is `XX-title.md` where XX is the position on the sidebar.
  * Example: Documentation about troubleshooting would be named `05-troubleshooting.md` if it's the fifth page on the sidebar.

## How to contribute

If you feel some documentation is missing then feel free to add it. If you feel like something could be improved then feel free to improve it.

Documentation isn't where you should express yourself like you can in [`../posts`](../posts/), it should be a place for others to get help about the bot.

Examples are allowed in the documentation. More in-depth tutorials should go in [`../tutorials`](../tutorials/) instead of being written here.
